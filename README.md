- 👋 Hi, I’m @forestTiger80 and I'm teaching programing at Åssiden upper secondary school in Drammen,  About 43km form Oslo.
- 👀 I’m interested in web, mobile applications and cloud services. I spend a lot of time coding, but also find the best way to teach what I've learned. It takes time, but I love it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning flutter, HTML and JS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on teaching coding.
- 📫 How to reach me... edgardos@viken.no
